# Cynthia-Dash

Cynthia dash is a web shell for managing Cynthia, it runs as an extension of Cynthia.
For performance reasons, it is not enabled by default. You need to install it as
a plugin.

Dash lives in it's own [repository](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/CynthiaWeb-dash)
for now, but it might be merged into the main Cynthia repository in the future.

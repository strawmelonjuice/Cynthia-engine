- [x] Add CynthiaPluginLoader v2 to CynthiaEngine-RS
    - Will consist of both a Node/BunJS and a binairy mode
    - Should be working through just running the plugin with specified arguments, then parsing the output (through stdout) as JSON. Will (indeed) be preeetty prone to error.
    - [x] Make Javascript RE available as a function
    - [ ] Add bin mode to modifiers
- [x] Reimplement postlist pages and filters
  - [ ] Parse them through a handlebars loop, instead of pregenerating an html table.
- [x] Add HTML meta tags to each post
- [ ] Add RSS/Atom feeds functionality
- [ ] Add sitemap.xml generation
- [ ] Write logs to files, too.
- [ ] CynthiaDash reimplementation as setting instead of plugin
- [ ] Major refactor (as of )

- [x] Add CynthiaPluginLoader v2 to CynthiaCMS-RS
    - Will consist of both a Node/BunJS and a binairy mode
    - Should be working through just running the plugin with specified arguments, then parsing the output (through stdout) as JSON. Will (indeed) be preeetty prone to error.
    - [x] Make Javascript RE available as a function
    - [ ] Add bin mode to modifiers
- [ ] Reimplement postlist pages and filters

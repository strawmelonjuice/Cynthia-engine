# CynthiaConf

Cynthia's configuration can be written in [`TOML`](https://toml.io/) (`Cynthia.toml`), [`Dhall`](https://dhall-lang.org/) (`Cynthia.dhall`) and [`JSON`]([JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)) (`Cynthia.json`). `TOML` is the current default, and as such, these docs will mostly document CynthiaDocs with TOML examples.

## Conversion

Cynthia can convert between config languages using the `cynthiaweb convert <lang>` command.

# Dates object

A dates object consists of two numbers, both [UNIX-timestamps](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/).
These timestamps identify two important moments for a publication:

- Publication date
- Last alteration date

An example:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "dates": {
    "published": 1721685763,
    "altered": 1744488163,
  },
}
```

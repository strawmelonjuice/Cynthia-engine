# Docs

Obviously, Cynthia will self-host it's docs once v3 is far enoug. But for now, to keep docs available in this bridging period... Bamn! GitHub Pages (I don't hate them as bad as WordPress, but...)

A little table-of-content for each subject down below:

## For everyone

- [Enabling or disabling Cynthia features](./features.md)

## For webmasters (AKA Cynthia-admins)

- [Managing publications: `publications.jsonc`](./Admins/publication/published.jsonc.md)

- [Configuring Cynthia: `CynthiaConf`](./Admins/configuration/CynthiaConf.md)
  
  - [Setting up scenes](./Admins/configuration/CynthiaConf/scenes.md)
  
  - [Writing templates](./Admins/customisation/templates.md)

## For developers

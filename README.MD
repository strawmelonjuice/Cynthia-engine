# Cynthia

Cynthia is a NodeJS alternative to the engine I built to host <https://strawmelonjuice.com/>. (The original engine is built on a mix of PHP and javascript, Cynthia is pure Javascript.)

The philosophy?

Sure, WordPress can be useful, and can be the best way to set up your web site.
But if you like thinkering about with configuration files and like writing your pages in markdown (yes, that's the default format!), then join the Cynthia side (basically Jekyll but less... Jekyll, and no Ruby).

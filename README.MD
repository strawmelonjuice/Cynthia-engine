# CynthiaCMS - Rust Version

Rust version of <https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/CynthiaCMS>.

CynthiaCMS was first written in TypeScript, which helped me create most of the file structure.  I personally am not sure if TypeScript would be the best language, so... I am going to rewrite existing Cynthia support in Rust (and some other languages, but Rust is the first 2nd language to *go* public) 

If determined superior (performance not per se, but developability), this Rust branch will take over the main branch. If not, it'll die.

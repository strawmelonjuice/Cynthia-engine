# Cynthia!(.rs)
- Generating websites
- Serving them
- Using a simple file-based content management system (CMS)
<font style="color: red"><b>

Cynthia is in active development, but not ready for full production usage! It has some releases for testing, but none are marked as 'ready' at the moment.

This page is either found on [/p/about/](/p/about/) in your fresh Cynthia install, or on <https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/CynthiaCMS-JS/blob/main/README.MD>.

Cynthia is an alternative to the engine I built to host <https://strawmelonjuice.com/>. (The original engine is built on a mix of PHP and javascript, Cynthia is pure Rust (yes, Rust!).)

The philosophy?

Sure, WordPress can be useful, and can be the best way to set up your website.
But if you like tinkering about with configuration files and like writing your pages in markdown (yes, that's Cynthia's default format!), then join the Cynthia side (basically Jekyll but less... Jekyll, and no Ruby).
Oh! Aaand, for those who like using a panel or app to change their site, yes. It will come. But as a plugin!
## Getting started

_The docs for this will come, when cynthia is ready for usage!_
